# Poker Game

Poker is a card game in which players bet over which hand is best according to the game's rules.

Cards are dealt in a phased manner. Here are the  stages

- Hole cards - Each player (who are still in the round) gets dealt 2 cards. 
-  Flop - 3 card are placed in the center. 
- Turn - 1 more card is placed in center.
- River - 1 more card is placed in center.
- Show

Before each stage , any of the players can bet more or raise the bet. In order to remain in the round , other players need to match the amount .i.e "Call" , or "Raise" it furthure. If they dont want to match the amount , they can "fold" the cards and stay out for that round. 

All the money collected as part of bets goes to a "pot". 

After "show" , best hands (best combination) for each player , who are still in the round, is determined . 


Hand for a player is decided among the 7 cards. 
7 cards = 2 hole  + 5 community cards
        = 2 hole  + 3 flop + 1 turn + 1 river
 
 
The player with the best hand wins the pot.And the winner takes it all.
