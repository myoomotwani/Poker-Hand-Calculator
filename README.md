Before each stage , any of the players can bet more or raise the bet. In order to remain in the round , other players need to match the amount .i.e "Call" , or "Raise" it furthure. If they dont want to match the amount , they can "fold" the cards and stay out for that round. 

All the money collected as part of bets goes to a "pot". 

After "show" , best hands (best combination) for each player , who are still in the round, is determined . 


Hand for a player is decided among best 5 out of the 7 cards for the player. </br>
<pre> 7 cards = 2 hole  + 5 community cards </br>
         = 2 hole  + 3 flop + 1 turn + 1 river </pre>
 
 
The player with the best hand wins the pot.And the winner takes it all.

# Project scope

# Classes and project structure

- Card class to represent a card in the deck
- Combination class to represent a hand enum and related info
- Suite enum
- Dealer represents an entity that deals cards accordingly. it is not the dealer which is the player. 
- combinationfinder package - various combination finders are packed in one folder. 


# How to run

There are 2 flavors to run this program

- Actual game play : In this flavor , Dealer class generates a pack of 52 cards. Shuffles cards using random generator. Then deals cards accordingly.
For each of the players , winning hand is then determined. Run PokerGamePlayDemo class to use this mode. 

- Hard coded cards : In this flavor , we can hard code the cards and test the program against those cards. This is useful while testing as in dealer based approach we don't have control over which cards will be dealt. Run TestHandDemo class  to use this mode. Use HardCodedDealer to change the cards. 


# Roadmap

- Cover remaining hand types.
- Add JUnit test cases.
